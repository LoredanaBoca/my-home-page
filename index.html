      My name is Loredana Boca and I'm learning to become an Software Developer.<br>I develop this passion recently when my partner took me thru some of his work.<br>I have a degree in management and curently working as an customer service adviser for an pharmaceutical company.<br>I found this domain very interesting and creative.<br>I love that beeing a creative person,this helps me to express myself and same time to learn and acknowledge so many interesting things<br>
      I love the way things works,the challenge and team work involved.<br>
      It's quite a challenge for me, but I love challenges as at the end of each I am a winner(the amount of things learned,people i meet).<br>I'm looking forward for a great and bright future.
